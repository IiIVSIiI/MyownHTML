            <p>
                All products in our store are sold with delivery. Delivery within Kiev is carried out within one day. We deliver without prepayment in all regional centers of Ukraine. In this case, you will receive your order the next day. You can purchase any of our
                products on credit even without a down payment.

                More about shipping costs
            </h3>
            <p>
                It is possible to pay for your order in several ways. We accept: cash payment, bank transfer. All products in our store are accompanied by a guarantee. Confirmation of the warranty is a corporate warranty card.
            </p>
            <p>
                We value our reputation, and therefore deliberately do not sell unofficial or illegal goods without warranty and service support in Ukraine. In the end, buying products of dubious origin is a headache for both the seller and the buyer.
